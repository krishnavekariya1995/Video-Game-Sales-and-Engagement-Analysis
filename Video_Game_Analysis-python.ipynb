        "This project presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of global video game sales and engagement patterns using Python, SQL(MySQL), and Power BI. The primary objective was to transform raw historical sales and game metadata into actionable business insights that support marketing strategy, product development decisions, demand forecasting, and resource allocation planning.\n",
        "The analysis was conducted using two primary datasets. The first dataset contained video game sales information, including platform, release year, publisher, and regional as well as global sales figures. The second dataset included game-level metadata such as ratings, wishlist counts, engagement indicators, and developer information. Together, these datasets enabled a holistic view of both commercial performance and user behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project followed a structured analytical workflow. Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using Python, where missing values were handled, data types were standardized, and inconsistencies were resolved. SQL was then used to perform structured queries, aggregations, ranking, and table joins to extract key performance indicators and validate relationships between sales and engagement metrics. This step ensured that relational database principles were properly applied and demonstrated competency in query-based analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Power BI was used to design an interactive visual report structured into multiple business-focused pages. Rather than building a single exploratory dashboard, the report was organized to guide decision-making. The first section provides a market overview, highlighting total global sales and platform-wise performance. The analysis reveals that a small number of platforms dominate overall revenue generation, indicating strong market concentration and platform-driven commercial success.\n",
        "\n",
        "The marketing strategy section identifies high-performing platforms by ranking them based on global sales. The insights suggest that platform selection has a greater influence on revenue outcomes than individual game ratings alone. By incorporating time-based filtering through slicers, the analysis allows stakeholders to evaluate how platform performance evolved across different years, enabling period-specific marketing prioritization.\n",
        "\n",
        "The product performance and forecasting section evaluate average sales per game and visualizes historical sales trends using a rolling three-year moving average. Instead of relying on predictive modeling, the project adopts a trend-based forecasting approach, using historical patterns to assess demand direction and market stability. This approach supports practical planning decisions without overcomplicating the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final section focuses on resource allocation by calculating sales efficiency per platform. By analyzing revenue generated per game, the project identifies platforms that provide stronger return on investment. This insight directly supports development budget decisions and strategic investment planning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow-from data preparation and SQL querying to visualization and strategic interpretation. It emphasizes not only technical execution but also business alignment. The findings illustrate how structured data analysis can convert historical sales data into clear, actionable insights that support marketing optimization, product risk reduction, demand planning, and efficient resource allocation in the gaming industry."

        "The global video game industry operates across multiple platforms and regions, generating significant revenue while facing intense competition and rapidly changing consumer preferences. Businesses must continuously decide which platforms to prioritize, where to allocate marketing budgets, how to evaluate product launch success, and how to anticipate future demand trends. However, without structured data analysis, these decisions are often based on assumptions rather than evidence.\n",
        "The core problem addressed in this project is the lack of data-driven clarity regarding what factors most strongly influence video game sales performance. Specifically, it is necessary to understand how platform choice, regional dynamics, historical sales trends, and product-level performance metrics contribute to overall revenue outcomes. By analyzing historical sales and engagement data, this project aims to transform raw data into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making in marketing, product development, forecasting, and resource allocation."

        "First, prioritize high-performing genre–platform combinations. Action, Shooter, and Sports genres show strong performance in North America and Europe, while RPG titles perform relatively better in Japan. Development planning should be platform-specific. Releasing the right genre on the right platform increases probability of commercial success and improves marketing ROI.\n",
        "Second, use wishlist and engagement metrics as early demand indicators. Wishlist growth before launch strongly correlates with eventual sales performance. Marketing teams should monitor wishlist velocity and scale promotional budgets accordingly. If wishlist traction is weak, campaign strategy, pricing, or positioning should be adjusted before release.\n",
        "Third, balance quality with commercial positioning. Higher ratings generally align with stronger long-term performance, but ratings alone do not guarantee sales. Investment should be directed toward quality assurance, user experience optimization, and post-launch support, while also ensuring strong distribution and platform visibility.\n",
        "Fourth, allocate resources based on regional demand patterns. Sales concentration in NA and EU suggests heavier marketing spend in these regions for Action and Shooter titles, while Japan-focused campaigns should emphasize RPG and story-driven content. Localized marketing improves conversion efficiency.\n",
        "In summary, the client should:\n",
        "Focus on data-backed genre–platform alignment,\n",
        "Use engagement metrics for forecasting,\n",
        "Maintain high product quality,\n",
